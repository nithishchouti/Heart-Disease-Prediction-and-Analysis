## 4) Dataset Info:

● Name - Heart-Disease-Dataset-(Comprehensive)

● Heart disease is also known as Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year which is about 32 of all deaths globally. CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, and other conditions. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age.

● The five datasets used for its curation are database of instances:
  ○ Cleveland: 303
  ○ Hungarian: 294
  ○ Switzerland: 123
  ○ Long Beach VA: 200
  ○ Stalog (Heart) Data Set: 270

● Instances - 1190

● Features - 12

## 6) Project Scope:

● Provide an overview of the project, including the significance of predicting cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and the importance of data analysis and visualization in healthcare.

● Analyzing historical patient data to identify risk factors associated with CVDs.

● Developing predictive models based on the identified risk factors.

● Describing the sources of data, which may include electronic health records, medical databases, or research datasets.

● Performing statistical analyses, including summary statistics, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing to identify significant factors related to CVDs.

● Engineering new features if necessary to enhance the predictive power of the models.
