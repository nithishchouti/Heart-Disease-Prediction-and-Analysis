            - The project focuses on predicting cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) by analyzing historical patient data, developing predictive models, and enhancing healthcare outcomes through data-driven insights.
            - Predicting CVDs is crucial for early intervention and prevention, reducing mortality rates, and improving patient outcomes and quality of life.
            - Data analysis and visualization play a vital role in uncovering patterns, trends, and insights from complex healthcare data, aiding in decision-making and improving patient care.
            - Historical patient data is analyzed to identify risk factors associated with CVDs, enabling the development of effective predictive models.
            - Predictive models are created based on identified risk factors to forecast the likelihood of CVD occurrence in individuals.
